Teensy project with Adafruit TFT FEATHERWING - 2.4" 320X240

This project aims to create a generic midi controller for soft synthesizers (plug-ins), probably with Mackie support. 

Later on, hardware konbs will be added.

Background
Although there are many controllers out there, the generally are aimed on controlling DAW's instead of soft synths. 
After having tried a variaty of controllers like Nektar Panorama, NI Kore, NI Komplete Kontrol, and never feeling 
that they where "right", I have started this project, hoping to create the type of controller that really gives you 
a more hardware type of control feeling over your soft synths.

I know, it is ambitious, but, well... Keeps me of the street anyway.
